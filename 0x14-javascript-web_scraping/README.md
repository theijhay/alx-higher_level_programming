How to manipulate JSON data
How to use request and fetch API
How to read and write a file using fs module

# Requirements

All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node (version 14.x)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/node
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should be semistandard compliant. Rules of Standard + semicolons on top. Also as reference: AirBnB style
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
